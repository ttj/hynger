# Hynger (HYbrid iNvariant GEneratoR) #

[Hynger Homepage](http://verivital.com/hynger/)

Hynger instruments Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) block diagrams to generate textual log output files from SLSF simulations.  In particular, Hynger allows for integrating the Daikon invariant inference tool with SLSF diagrams.

## INSTALLATION: ##

1) Clone the Hynger repository:
```
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/verivital/hynger
```

As some large trace files were committed in earlier versions, if hg has some problems you may try:
```
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/verivital/hynger -r 10
cd hynger/
hg pull -r 100
hg pull -r 20
hg pull -r 30
hg pull -r 40
hg update
hg fetch
```

2) [Download Daikon](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/) and put daikon\daikon.jar at the path:

```
hynger\lib\daikon.jar
```
If an external version of Daikon is desired, the appropriate path may be entered in hynger.m.

## EXAMPLES:##
Several examples are included in the directory examples/.

A buck converter with hysteresis controller is described in 'buck_hvoltage_discrete.slx' (or .mdl).

These include the case study described in the ICCPS 2015 paper, as well as other models tested (from the ARCH 2014 workshop, models provided by Mathworks with Matlab, etc.).

## RUNNING:##

1) From the 'src' directory, execute:

```
clear all ; hynger('buck_hvoltage_discrete', 1)
```

2) This should instrument the diagram, simulate it, creating the traces in the file:

daikon-output\output_buck_hvoltage_discrete.dtrace

3) The second argument 1 will enable feeding the resulting traces to Daikon, then generate candidate invariants.  The resulting invariants will be in the file:

```
daikon-output\output_buck_hvoltage_discrete.inv
```

### NOTES: ###
This will automatically try to call Daikon (specified by the second argument 1).  In case of problems using this (as the Matlab-to-Java interface is a little delicate and can cause Matlab to crash if the called Java program terminates with certain exit codes), you may try:

```
clear all ; hynger('buck_hvoltage_discrete', 0)
```

The manual command to call Daikon from Matlab will then be printed to screen.

## INSTRUMENTING OTHER BLOCKS: ##
1) By default, Hynger will instrument ONLY subsystem and function blocks.

Alternative modes include:
A)
Every block mode: Instrumenting EVERY block in EVERY sub-diagram recursively.  This may not be desired, as it may incur a heavy performance overhead.  To change the blocks that are instrumented, see hynger.m.

B) Whitelist mode: This mode instruments ONLY blocks specified in a whitelist, see hynger.m and block_whitelist_instrumentation.m.

C) Blacklist mode: Another alternative mode is to instrument EVERY block except those provided by a blacklist (see hynger.m and the file block_blacklist_instrumentation.m).
